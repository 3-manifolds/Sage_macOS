In order for Sage to run on older macOS systems we need to specify a
minimum target of 10.9 and we need to disable AVX2 instructions.  There
are Intel CPUs which are new enough to run Big Sur yet do not support
AVX2.

Setting the minimum OS version target has become trickier now that Apple's
ld accepts the new -platform_version option.  Just using -mmacosx-version-min=10.9
is no longer sufficient.  A number of libraries, including libreadline and
libhistory will be built with the minimum target set to 11.0 instead of
10.9.  This can be worked around by setting *both* the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
environment variables.

Here are the build commands we use:

$ export CFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.9 -mno-avx2"
$ export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-platform_version,macos,10.9,11.3"
$ make
