Several things need to be in place before you can run the scripts which build
the SageMath frameworks and app.  You may need to install XCode in order to
have the xcrun notarize-app and xcrun staple commands available.

Macher
------

Download and install macher from:
https://github.com/culler/macher/releases/download/v1.3/macher

This is a single file executable which can go anywhere in your path.
It is used by the fix_paths.py script in Sage_framework.

Sage Source Code
----------------

The scripts assume that a clone of the SageMath github repository is located in
Sage_framework/repo/sage where the bigrepo is used to build an expanded version
of SageMath that includes as mony optional packages as possible. The scripts
build_sage.sh and build_big_sage.sh handle the configuration and build.

Note that currently the gfortran spkg does not build on arm64 systems.
Instead, the build script assumes that the Homebrew gfortran is installed on the
system and it copies the gfortran libraries into the bundle and adjusts their
load paths.

----------------------

The TclTk_framework directory should contain subdirectories Tk and Tcl
which contain appropriate versions of the corresponding source code.
If you have fossil repositories, say named Tcl.fossil and Tk.fossil
somewhere on your system, then you can create the Tcl directories and
run, for example.

% cd Tcl
% fossil open /path/to/Tcl.fossil core-8-branch
% cd ../Tk
% fossil open /path/to/Tk.fossil core-8-branch

Credentials
-----------

Code signing requires that you have two certificates installed in the Keychain
Access app.  One is used for signing Applications with codesign and one is
used for signing Installers with productsign.  If you are a registered Apple
developer and have received the certificates from Apple then they will be
identified by your Apple developer id.  If they are self-signed then you will
choose the id.  Notarization also requires a one-time-password registered
with Apple.

Your Apple developer id and one-time-password should be assigned to
environment variables in a script named IDs.sh in this directory.  That
script will be sourced when credentials are needed.

package/IDs.sh :
export APPLE_ID=user@example.com
export ONE_TIME_PASS=abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop
export DEV_ID=YOURCERTID

Build Steps
-----------

The bin directory contains scripts which handle each step of building the
application bundle, once the Sage distribution has been built.  A valid
Apple developer id is needed to run the scripts build_dist, notarize_app,
and notarize_dmg.  However, the build_dist can be modified by commenting
out the 4 lines in the section "Render templates and install the package"
in order to allow building a signed but unnotarized copy of the app,
without the associated extras package.  This does require a self-signed
certificate, which must be listed in IDs.sh.

The steps are:
# Build Sage and the Sage documentation
cd Sage_framework
bash build_sage.sh
# If Sage built successfully, continue ...
bash build_sage_docs.sh
# Verify that the documentation looks OK (requires cocoserver)
coco repo/documentation
# Build the app
cd ..
bin/build_dist
# This provides the app.  If you have a valid Developer ID you can now
# notarize the app and the installer ...
bin/quick_dmg
bin/notarize_app # takes 45 minutes or so
bin/fancy_dmg
bin/notarize_dmg # takes another 45 minutes or so

Building the frameworks
-----------------------

The Sage framework is built (once Sage has been compiled) with:
% cd Sage_framework
% bash build_sage_framework.sh
% cd ..

The Tcl and Tk frameworks are built with:
% cd TclTk_frameworks
% make
% cd ..

The frameworks are signed as part of the build process.

Building the installer
----------------------

% cd package
% bash build_package.sh
% cd ..

Assembling the app
------------------
For version X.Y of sage:

% mkdir SageMath-X.Y
% cp -R app_template SageMath-X.Y/SageMath-X-Y.app
% mv Sage_framework/build/Sage.framework SageMath-X.Y/SageMath-X-Y.app/Contents/Frameworks
% mv TclTk_frameworks/Frameworks/*.framework SageMath-X.Y/SageMath-X-Y.app/Contents/Frameworks
% mv package/Recommended_X_Y.pkg SageMath-X.Y

Signing the app
---------------
% codesign -s YOURCERTID -vvvv --timestamp --options runtime --force --entitlements\
Sage_framework/entitlement.plist SageMath-X.Y/SageMath-X-Y.app

The notarization dance
----------------------
Once the app has been signed, notarization requires these steps, which assume
that you have created a notarization profile with the command
% xcrun notarytool store-credentials --apple-id XXXX --password YYYY --team-id ZZZZ
* Create a disk image from the directory SageMath-X.Y
* Send the disk image to Apple to be notarized:
  % xcrun notarytool submit SageMath-9.6.dmg --keychain-profile your_profile --wait
* Staple the notarization ticket to the app:
  % xcrun stapler staple SageMath-X.Y/SageMath-X-Y.app
* Create a new disk image from the directory SageMath-X.Y
* Send the new disk image to Apple to be notarized.
* Staple the notarization ticket to the disk image:
  % xcrun stapler staple SageMath-X.Y.dmg
