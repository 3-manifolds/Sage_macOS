When the SageMath X.Y app is built, the sage root is
/var/tmp/sage-X.Y-current.  When the app runs it ensures that
/var/tmp/sage-X.Y-current is a symlink to the sage root in the
app bundle.  Consequently, when building the sage_base the
sage_base directory should be renamed as /var/tmp/sage-X.Y-current.

The easiest way to arrange this is to use the build_base.sh script.
